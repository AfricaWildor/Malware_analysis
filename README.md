# Malware_analysis
This is an project of Cognate Malware Recognition Based on Image Classification Technology.

This project is divided into three parts:

## Part1：Malware samples to image

​	In the first part, there are two steps. 

- First of all, we should collect enough malicious samples, which are implemented through the API of the crawler or website; 
- Secondly, try a reasonable image conversion algorithm to convert the executable file into an image.

## Part2：Machine learning based on densenet

## Part3：An complete detection model
